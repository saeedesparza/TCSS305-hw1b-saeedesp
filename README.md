Homework 1b

## Assignment Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize us as students with the
Record class and its implementation. More significant than this is that this
assignment's purpose is to allow us to learn more about what collections work
best for what we are attempting to accomplish within our program. Also, at its
core, this assignment's main purpose is to introduce us to JUnit and teach us
how to test our code thoroughly, rigorously, correctly, and concisely.

## Technical Impression:
This assignment tested my skills in successfully implementing a HashMap for use in
the StoreCart class. I also had to go online and watch a few videos to brush up
on them, as its been a while since I had used one. I also found myself watching videos
and reading the Java API regarding Records, as I had never heard of the class prior to
this assignment. I had trouble creating my StoreCart and StoreCartTest classes,
but after seeking exterior help from online sources and the TLC, I got to where I needed
to be. I now feel that I am significantly more understanding of HashMaps, JUnit testing,
and how to use unit testing to ensure that my code is accurate and precise.
I also noticed that I was having trouble figuring out what exactly is so important about
HashCode where we need to override the class given to create a new version of it. I also
don't feel that I fully understand the equals() method, so I will need to go back to the
Panopto recordings to ensure that I grasp these concepts better. Finally, I realized that
I am better at programming than I initially thought entering into this course; I probably
won't think that way for super long since there's always more to learn, but I am definitely
finding a better style of learning and understanding.

## Unresolved problems in my submission:
I feel as though I could have been more rigorous in my testing, but I also noticed that
a lot of the test methods already test other methods within themselves; so I figured that
the amount of tests I had was sufficient to the scope of the project.
